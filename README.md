# Build a Recipe Box
**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/xVXWag/.
#### User stories:
  1. I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.
  2. I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.
  3. I can click into any of those recipes to view it.
  4. I can edit these recipes.
  5. I can delete these recipes.
  6. All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.
